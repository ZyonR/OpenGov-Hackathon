Philippine budget process: Everything you need to know,"Budget preparation The Philippine Constitution requires the submission of the President’s budget 30 days from the opening of each regular session of Congress. The first steps of the annual budget preparation begins with the determination of the overall economic targets, expenditure levels, revenue projection, and the financing plan by the Development Budget Coordinating Committee (DBCC). Following this, the DBM will issue a Budget Call, which defines the budget framework; sets economic and fiscal targets; prescribes the priority thrusts and budget levels; and spells out the guidelines and procedures, technical instructions, and the timetable for budget preparation. The various government agencies will then prepare their respective detailed budget estimates that rank programs, projects, and activities using the capital budgeting approach and submit these to the DBM. Budget hearings are then conducted, where agencies justify their proposed budgets before the DBM technical panels. After the submission of proposed expenditure programs by the respective agencies, and the subsequent approval by the DBCC, the proposed budget is reviewed and approved by the President and the Cabinet. Finally, the President submits the proposed budget to Congress. Budget authorization The President submits his proposed annual budget to Congress in the following documents: Budget of Expenditure and Sources of Financing (BESF) National Expenditure Program (NEP), containing the details of proposed expenditures President’s Budget Message, summarizing the budget policy thrusts and priorities for the year Article VI, Section 24, of the 1987 Philippine Constitutions provides for Congress’ authority for “all appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the public debt, bills of local application, and private bills,” which is why Congress is often considered as having the “power of the purse.” The House of Representatives is first to review the proposed budget. Budget hearings for each department or agency are held by the appropriations committee together with the respective House subcommittees to scrutinize the details of the proposed programs and projects. The House’s amendments are reflected in its General Appropriations Bill approved by the House body. While these hearings are taking place in the House, the Senate finance committee, along with its different subcommittees, will simultaneously conduct its own hearings on the proposed budget and submit its own amendments as well. The role of the Senate is to propose or concur with amendments to the General Appropriations Bill passed by the House. A Senate General Appropriations Bill reflecting amendments is approved by the Senate body. Any differences in the respective bills are threshed out by a bicameral conference committee, which is composed of members from both the House and the Senate. A common, harmonized version is finalized as the General Appropriations Bill (GAB). Once the GAB is finalized and approved by Congress, the President signs and enacts it into law as the General Appropriations Act for that fiscal year. The 1987 Constitution provides that “If, by the end of any fiscal year, the Congress shall have failed to pass the general appropriations bill for the ensuing fiscal year, the general appropriations law for the preceding fiscal year shall be deemed reenacted and shall remain in force and effect until the general appropriations bill is passed by the Congress.” Important budget documents Throughout the budget process, the details of the proposed programs and expenditure amounts are published and can be found on the website of the Department of Budget and Management:https://dbm.gov.ph/.

2025 budget ‘blanks’: Billions involved in DA adjustments after ratification,"There were also increases, the most notable of which was the funding for the National Fisheries Program. The budget approved by the House worth P6.272 billion was changed to blank in the bicam, yet when the President signed the GAA, an additional P2.298 billion was allocated to the program. The adjustments, based on Rappler’s research, are summarized below. What’s the issue? The budget cycle every year is continuous. The executive branch led by the Department of Budget and Management prepares the National Expenditure Program (NEP), which is the President’s proposed budget that will be the subject of congressional approval. The House receives the NEP, which becomes the basis of the General Appropriations Bill. After the House passes the spending bill, it sends the GAB to the Senate, which passes its own version. Select members of both chambers convene to harmonize disagreeing provisions of their own drafts through the bicameral conference committee. Once the said committee reconciles the differences, they sign a report which contains the said amendments, ratified separately by both chambers. This is now the final version of the budget, and the House prints an enrolled copy sent to Malacañang for the President’s signature. The adjustments discovered, however, raise various questions: When were the blanks on the bicameral conference committee report filled out? Who was responsible for filling out the blanks on the bicameral conference committee report, since the copy signed by the President already had values indicated in the blanks? How were the budget cuts and bumps decided upon if the bicameral conference committee members signed a report that contained blanks? Davao City 3rd District Representative Isidro Ungab, who was once chairperson of the appropriations committee, first flagged the blanks during a podcast streamed on the Facebook page of Davao City Mayor Sebastian Duterte on Saturday, January 18. Former president Rodrigo Duterte, who was a guest on his son’s online show, claimed that this made the 2025 budget invalid. President Marcos fired back at his predecessor on Monday, January 20,accusing Duterte of lying, and insisted that the General Appropriations Act did not contain blanks. The GAA,according to the Office of the Ombudsman, “covers the annual operating requirements of agencies of government” and is “the most comprehensive source of appropriation cover for the budget of the government.” While Marcos’ statement is true, it does not directly debunk Ungab’s statement, since the latter was referring to the blanks on the bicameral conference committee report. Kabataan Representative Raoul Manuel later echoed Ungab’s concerns, confirming on Wednesday, January 22, that the blanks were contained in the report disseminated to the House members on December 11, 2024, just minutes before the plenary voted on its ratification. “Every item in the budget, before it is proposed, before it is submitted, before it is approved by whoever, there should be a number. So the existence of blanks on the budget of the Department of Agriculture is a valid issue,” budget expert Zy-za Suzara said in an interview onFacts First Tonightwith Christian Esguerra on Monday, January 20. “We don’t know of course what the reason is because there’s no transparency in the bicam,” she said, referring to the closed-door nature of the deliberations. Constitutional question? Some sectors have suggested raising this budget’s constitutionality issues with the courts, but former congressman and budget secretary Butch Abad has doubts these would prosper. Abad told Rappler he had never encountered the issue of blanks in the bicam report during his time as a lawmaker, as well as during his six-year stint preparing then-president Benigno Aquino III’s budget. He doubts that issues of legality this time around will prosper in courts. “There is a such thing as doctrine of enrolled bill, which states that an enrolled bill is conclusively presumed enacted in accordance with the procedural constitutional requirements. And if you’re looking for evidence to question that, there is no other evidence beyond the enrolled bill itself,” Abad said. The Supreme Court will no longer interfere if the House or the Senate followed their internal rules of procedure. I think that flows from the principle of independence of branches,” he added. Rappler has reached out to Ako Bicol Representative Zaldy Co and Senator Grace Poe, who headed their chamber’s delegations in the bicam, for clarity, but has yet to receive a response. Poe, in an ambush interview with GMA News on Thursday, January 23, said: “I don’t see any problem [with the bicam report]… When we completed the bicam report and we submitted it as an enrolled bill, it was complete.” –Rappler.com Error.",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/data-documents/philippine-budget-2025-blanks-adjustments-after-ratification/
Claims of blank items in 2025 budget bicam report misleading,"I have recently encountered a plethora of comments, opinions, and news articles across different media outlets, social media platforms, and bloggers’ channels discussing the alleged blank items in the 2025 national budget. What specifically do they mean by “blank items”? As outlined in Rule XII, Section 34 of the Senate Rules, the Senate President appoints members of the Senate panel in the conference committee, known as conferees. The authority granted to Senate conferees is focused on resolving disagreements between the two chambers. They are not permitted to remove provisions or language that have been agreed upon by both the House of Representatives and the Senate to introduce entirely new provisions. However, conferees do have a significant degree of flexibility, except in cases where the disagreements are very specific. Once an agreement is reached on a bill, the conference committee staff will draft a conference report. The report details the modifications made and provides explanations for each side’s decisions. The report is then presented to the floor for approval. Final approval of the bill is achieved when both houses agree on the conference report, along with any amendments made to resolve disagreements.  Upon closer examination, I realized that the term “blank items” was likely being misapplied to the bicameral report. I believe that the concerns about “blank items” actually pertain to the General Appropriations bill (GAB), which is attached to the bicameral report. The GAB is the proposed law that outlines the government’s budget for a specific fiscal year, and certain provisions within the bill may have been left unspecified or “blank.” The bicameral report, on the other hand, contains the findings and recommendations of the bicameral conference committee regarding the GAB.  The bicameral report, GAB, and General Appropriations Act (GAA) are integral components of the budgeting process. The GAB is deliberated upon by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, with each chamber providing input and suggestions to ensure that the bill aligns with their respective priorities and concerns. Once the House and Senate reach an agreement on the GAB, a bicameral conference committee is convened to iron out any remaining differences and finalize the bill. The committee is composed of representatives from both the House and Senate. The bicameral report, which contains the committee’s findings and recommendations regarding the GAB, is then produced. Simply put, the bicameral report is a comprehensive document that outlines the agreed-upon provisions, allocations, and amendments to the GAB. This report is the culmination of the bicameral conference committee’s deliberations and negotiations, and provides a detailed account of the committee’s findings and recommendations. As such, the bicameral report is not intended to contain “blank items” or unspecified provisions, except when it refers to the GAB itself. Any claims of “blank items” in the bicameral report are likely misinformed or misleading, and may be referring to the GAB instead. The bicameral report, along with the attached copy of the GAB, is typically reported to both the Senate and the House of Representatives for approval. Once both chambers have approved the bicameral report, the GAB is enacted into law, and then signed by the President, becoming the GAA. One of the most important questions to consider is whether the bicameral report along with the attached reviewed appropriation bill has been submitted to both houses for approval. If this has been done, it is unlikely that there will be any blank items in the appropriation bill. However, if this has not been completed, then the situation must be addressed differently.  It is concerning that lawmakers, especially those involved in reviewing the GAB and drafting the bicameral report, have differing opinions on the issue of blank items. REGINALD B.

Makabayan wants bicam to convene again to address budget issues,"France Castro —House of Representatives/Facebook France Castro —House of Representatives/Facebook MANILA, Philippines — The bicameral conference committee that finalized the proposed 2025 national budget must reconvene again to address alleged allocation issues, lawmakers from the House of Representatives Makabayan bloc said on Monday. In a statement, Makabayan bloc members — ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro, Gabriela party-list Rep. Arlene Brosas, and Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel — said that the 2025 General Appropriations Bill (GAB) appears to be mismanaged because allocation for key social programs has been slashed. “The approved budget not only slashes critical funding for social services but also bloats discretionary funds and pork barrel allotments, prioritizing the ambitions of the political elite over the needs of ordinary Filipinos.  The bicameral committee’s deliberation despite being televised, was riddled with opacity. The public was kept in the dark about the specific amendments, their justifications, and their impacts on urgent social services,” the Makabayan bloc said. “We call on the House and Senate leadership to address the growing public outcry by immediately recalling the ratified General Appropriations Bill and reconvening the bicameral conference committee.  The bicam must restore the slashed budgets for social services and remove all pork barrel allotments in infrastructure projects. This should be done under full public transparency, with proceedings broadcast live for the Filipino people to witness,” they added. Among the points in the GAB raised by the Makabayan bloc include the following: “The bicameral report also retains the questionable AKAP program. Together with other politicized social safety net funds, this is a thinly veiled attempt to legalize “ayuda politics” for the 2025 elections, routing public funds through politicians to enable massive vote-buying disguised as financial assistance. Such a move not only undermines the integrity of elections but also turns the General Appropriations Act into a tool for electioneering,” Makabayan claims. “Despite widespread calls for accountability, President Bongbong Marcos’ P4.5 billion in confidential and intelligence funds (CIFs) was left untouched. Worse, the bicam even increased the Office of the President’s budget by an additional P5.4 billion without any transparent justification,” they added. According to the Makabayan lawmakers, it is not unprecedented to recall a bill that a bicameral conference committee has approved, as this has been done with the Magna Carta for Seafarers, when it was still a proposed measure. Last February 26, the House adopted House Concurrent Resolution No. 23, which withdrew Senate Bill No. 2221 and House Bill No. 7325 from its enrollment in Malacañang.  The withdrawal was made on the same day Marcos was supposed to sign the bills into law. “We note that reconvening a bicameral conference committee to address flaws in its report is not unprecedented. The bicam for the Magna Carta for Seafarers was reconvened three times, even after ratification, in order to address certain alleged flaws before it was signed into law by the President,” Makabayan said. “Finally, we reaffirm our stand that a genuine people’s budget must prioritize the welfare of the Filipino masses—health care, education, housing, and decent jobs—not the pockets of the powerful few. It should serve to promote genuine agrarian reform, national industrialization, and an independent foreign policy,” they added. Previously, Education Secretary Sonny Angara lamented that after the bicam came out with its committee report, DepEd suffered cuts into its proposed budget for computerization. Eventually, Angara said that Marcos has vowed to “remedy” this cut in DepEd’s budget, “President [Marcos] himself told us he will remedy this,” Angara said. READ:Angara: Marcos to remedy huge DepEd budget cut Undelivered laptops were among the issues discussed at the deliberations of DepEd’s proposed budget last September 2 — just weeks after Angara took the helm over Vice President Duterte. During the discussions, DepEd Director Ferdinand Pitagan confirmed that only P2.18 billion out of P11.36 billion funds for computers, laptops, and smart television sets — items crucial for e-learning — were spent.

Jefferson Khonghun explained that utilization rates, or the amount of funds used by an agency for a specific project, has been a consideration for Congress in crafting the proposed budget. READ:Solons: DepEd has to prove first it can disburse, use funds properly Meanwhile, Tingog party-list Rep. Jude Acidre and La Union 1st District Rep. Paolo Ortega V clarified that DepEd’s budget slash was not reflective of Angara’s performance, but of the agency’s inability to use funds efficiently.",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2016000/makabayan-wants-bicam-to-convene-again-to-address-budget-issues
Hontiveros rejects Duterte’s ‘blank items’ claim vs 2025 budget,"Senate Deputy Minority Leader Risa Hontiveros  (Senate Public Relations and Information Bureau) Senate Deputy Minority Leader Risa Hontiveros  (Senate Public Relations and Information Bureau) MANILA,  Philippines— Although she voted against this year’s P6.326 trillion national budget, opposition Sen. Risa Hontiveros expressed doubts Congress would pass any budget with blank items, as claimed by former president Rodrigo Duterte. This is still in response to allegations that the 2025 budget was riddled with blanks.  According to  Hontiveros, she did not sign the Congressional bicameral committee report on the budget after it scrapped theP74 billion subsidy for the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth)and reduced funding for the public and education sectors. She, along with  Senate Minority  Leader  Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel  III, later voted against it when the upper chamber ratified the budget measure last  December 11, 2024. “Pero talagang hindi naman  ako makapaniwala  na magpapasa ng anumang  budget ang Kongreso ng ating Republika  na may blank di ba?” Hontiveros  said over the Radyo 630 interview on Tuesday. (But I really cannot believe that Congress would pass any budget with blanks, right?) “Ano ba ito, hindi naman ito  test na pencils up, finish or not  finish pass your paper. Taon-taon tinatapos ng Kongreso ang trabaho namin para magpasa ng budget…” she said. (What is this? This is not a test where it’s pencils up, finish or not finish, pass your paper. Every year, Congress finishes its job of passing the budget. Part of this budgetary process allows every lawmaker the freedom to vote in favor of or against any budget measure,  the senator pointed out. “Pero siguro naman  tinapos namin yung aming trabaho kaya hindi ako maniwala dyan sa sinabi  ni Duterte,”  added Hontiveros, referring to former president Rodrigo  Duterte. (But I think we finished our work, so I don’t believe what former president Duterte said.) Duterte recently criticized the 2025 budget, saying that leaving some items in the bicameral report vacant was not acceptable. The former leader’s remarksdid not sit well with President  Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.. “He’s lying. He’s a president. He knows that you cannot pass a GAA with a blank. He’s lying. And he’s lying because he knows perfectly well that that doesn’t ever happen,” Marcos said in an interview on  Monday. It was Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab, former chairman of the House of Representatives’ appropriations committee, who earlier claimed that portions of the budget measure were left blank in the bicam report. Hontiveros surmised that Duterte might have been victimized by fake news.

Bigger problems in 2025 budget,"What’s so difficult about resolving this dragging furor over the alleged blank items in the congressional bicameral report on Republic Act No. 12116, or the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 2025? Former president Rodrigo Duterte insists that the P6.326-trillion national budget for 2025 is invalid, based on the claim of his ally Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab that the bicam report, which served as the basis for the GAA, had blank items in it. Calling his predecessor a liar, President Marcos challenged his critics to check the GAA on the website of the Department of Budget and Management if there were indeed blank items in it. Senate President Francis “Chiz” Escudero also denied Duterte’s claims, pointing out that there were no blank spaces in the bicam report that he signed. But Sen. Imee Marcos, the president’s elder sister, said the presence of blank items in the bicam report was one of the reasons she did not sign it. Senate Deputy Minority Leader Risa Hontiveros, who did not sign the bicam report nor voted for its ratification because of objectionable cuts to education programs and the defunding of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp.’s (PhilHealth), however, said she did not see any blank lines in the working drafts of the measure. The simple solution to resolving this controversy, as former senator Panfilo Lacson suggested, is to compare the bicam report ratified by both houses of Congress and the enrolled bill that was printed by the House of Representatives and submitted to Mr. Marcos for signing into law. Only such an exercise will clear this “he said, she said” situation and end this brouhaha. Lawmakers and the executive branch can then focus on the more pressing and substantial issues surrounding the 2025 national budget. On Jan. 31, members of the Clergy and Citizens for Good Governance (CCGG) have scheduled an “indignation concert and rally” at the Edsa Shrine to show their dissatisfaction with the 2025 GAA, which they branded as an “election budget and the worst budget in Philippine history.” CCGG claims the rally is backed by 12 Catholic bishops, three evangelical bishops and 230 priests, as well as “hundreds of military and uniformed personnel,” and 54 other civil society groups and youth organizations. Expected to attend are retired Supreme Court senior associate Justice Antonio Carpio, former information and communications technology undersecretary Eliseo Rio Jr., former presidential adviser Ronald Llamas, former finance undersecretary Cielo Magno, and former commission on audit commissioner Heidi Mendoza. “The main issue of the rally is the 2025 GAA, which is riddled with pork barrel, the zero subsidy for PhilHealth, and zero budget for DepEd’s (Department of Education) computerization program,” Carpio said in a radio interview. In a statement posted on social media, CCGG said it rejects the 2025 national budget because it allegedly promotes the interests of politicians and betrays the welfare of the Filipino people. It cited the defunding of PhilHealth purportedly to force Filipinos to beg for financial medical assistance from politicians; the slashing of the budget of the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program assistance project in favor of “ayuda” politics; the reduction in the budget for public transportation and the deprioritization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines modernization program, as well as the defunding of priority infrastructure projects and the placing the money under unprogrammed appropriations. The group said the GAA also undermined education by reducing the budget for many of its programs. All these, it argued, resulted in a violation of the Constitution that mandates the primacy of education in favor of pork barrel under the guise of critical public works projects. In the statement, CCGG called on the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the 2025 GAA; on Congress to repeal it and to rectify its flaws and enact a people’s budget by strengthening education, public health, and critical infrastructures, and defunding noncritical public works projects that promote corruption among politicians. All these problems hounding the 2025 national budget really boil down to one issue: transparency. As CCGG sums it: “We call for genuine transparency, full disclosure and accountability in all public acts on budget legislation, specifically the acts of the bicameral conference committee, and the utilization by the government.”",https://opinion.inquirer.net/180352/bigger-problems-in-2025-budget
Overhauling the 2025 GAA,"If it is any indication that the 2025 General Appropriations Act (GAA) badly mangled this year’s National Expenditure Program (NEP), President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. (PBBM) convened another budget meeting at Malacañan Palace last Monday (Jan. 13). On his first working day after the New Year, PBBM summoned to Malacañang Department of Budget and Management (DBM) Secretary Amenah Pangandaman for a briefing on the revisions done on the 2025 GAA. The Chief Executive initially went through the voluminous copies of the printed 2025 budget bill with a fine-toothed comb before he signed it into law on Dec. 30 last year. The President was assisted by Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin and the economic team led by Pangandaman. They went over the constitutional, legal and socio-economic issues and controversies arising from the “insertions” and realignments that got into the Congress-approved 2025 budget bill. At the end of this initial Palace vetting process, PBBM vetoed a whopping P194 billion from the Congress-approved 2025 budget that consisted mainly of new budget items that were not in the President’s NEP. From P6.352 trillion, the 2025 budget law was reduced a bit to P6.326 trillion. The bulk of vetoed items came from new items “inserted” in the 2025 GAA for the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), while the Department of Transportation (DOTr) suffered the biggest cut. Then again last Tuesday (Jan. 7), PBBM sat down with his entire Cabinet and tasked Pangandaman to explain the impact of the Congress-approved budget to their respective departments and agencies. They compared for the nth time the original submission to the 19th Congress of the NEP against the amendments done by lawmakers in the 2025 GAA. At our Kapihan sa Manila Bay last Wednesday (Jan. 8), Pangandaman explained some of the details pertaining to the “insertions” and realignments done in the 2025 GAA. The DBM chief pointed to the particular vetoed budget items that were those found inconsistent with the eight-point socio-economic agenda of the Marcos administration. So PBBM reviewed and went over so many times the fine print before and after he signed the 2025 GAA. Pangandaman disclosed to us PBBM instructed the heads of affected government agencies to reexamine the administration’s initiatives contained in the NEP but were defunded by Congress. The President, she explained, wanted agencies to focus on items critical to the socio-economic programs and restore the budget for critical projects that were not given funding by Congress. “We have to reexamine so that the programs that we wanted – that we put in the NEP – can somehow be restored,” PBBM was quoted in the official Palace statement after the 18th Cabinet meeting at Malacañang. “For the rest of the departments, I need you to give me the priorities – the things that we prioritized in the NEP that were removed in terms of budgeting, in terms of appropriations,” the President supposedly stressed. Now in the middle of his six-year term, PBBM is obviously in catch-up mode. Thus, the Chief Executive apparently would not want the administration’s programs taken in different directions other than ones he himself had set. After all these budget reviews were done, the line-item vetoes were traced to the amendments done at the bicameral conference committee (bicam). Dubbed as the “third” Congress, the bicam consolidated the differing provisions of the versions of the 2025 budget bill separately approved by the Senate and the House of Representatives. So the bicam actually crafted the final version of the 2025 GAA. Composed of an equal number of 12 senators and 12 House members, the bicam for the 2025 GAA was jointly headed by Sen. Grace Poe as chairperson of the Senate finance committee and Ako Bicol party-list Rep. Zaldy Co, as chairman of the House appropriations committee. Coming back from their month-long Christmas break, Co found himself removed as House appropriations committee chairman. When they resumed session last Monday, no less than presidential son, deputy House majority leader Ilocos Norte Rep. Sandro Marcos, presented a motion “declaring vacant” the chairmanship of the powerful House appropriations committee. Mentored on the legislative process by then House majority leader and now Speaker Martin Romualdez, the young Ilocos Norte congressman dealt the blow on Co’s fall from grace without much drama or fanfare. Hearing no objection from the floor to the motion of the President’s first-born son, the Speaker banged the gavel to signal the entire House in session approved the motion declaring “vacant” Co’s post. Co quickly sought to clarify though that he was not removed from the most coveted House committee chairmanship. According to Co, he supposedly left his post on his own volition “with a heavy heart.” His resignation, he added, was “driven by pressing health concerns” that took its toll, given the demanding role he had to play these past three years. After all, he cited, he headed this congressional body since June 2022. “I have always served at the pleasure of the majority. I am deeply honored to have been entrusted with the immense responsibility of steering the nation’s budget in service of the House of the people and the constituents we represent,” Co claimed. He extended his “heartfelt gratitude” to his House colleagues for “graciously accepting my decision to step down.” But there was not even a shedding of crocodile tears from Rep. Co’s fellow House members. The next day, in fact, the House leadership designated Marikina City Rep. Stella Quimbo as “acting” chairperson of the House appropriations committee. Billed as one of the resident economists of the 19th Congress, Quimbo is one of the senior vice chairpersons of Co in the same committee that has no more budget bill-related matters to take up. She is one of the lawmakers running in the May 12 national and local elections. Congress goes on recess on Feb. 7 for the campaign period. While the legislative body has the power of the purse, our Constitution though allows the Chief Executive to overhaul the Congress-approved budget without increasing or restoring cuts.",https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2025/01/15/2414208/overhauling-2025-gaa
P4.23 trillion released from 2025 budget,"MANILA, Philippines — Nearly 70 percent or P4.23 trillion of the record P6.326-trillion budget for 2025 has been released as the government ramps up the implementation of various programs, according to the Department of Budget and Management. Latest data from the DBM showed that the agency has released a total of P4.23 trillion of the 2025 budget as of end-February, representing 67 percent of the total allocation for the year. However, the amount is lower than the 79.3 percent in budget releases in the same period last year. Data showed that the DBM released P2.98 trillion under the 2025 General Appropriations Act (GAA). The amount is 70.6 percent of the total P4.22 trillion financing. Under the 2025 GAA, the DBM said it has distributed 76 percent or P2.81 trillion of the P3.69 trillion for departments. In terms of special purpose funds, releases amounted to  P173.54 billion, equivalent to 33 percent of the P529.6 billion allocation. On the other hand, automatic appropriations are at nearly 60 percent or P1.23 trillion of the P2.11 trillion aggregate funding. Broken down, the government finally released allocation for the tax expenditure fund at P9.43 billion, or 65 percent of the P14.5 billion allocation in February. Similarly, the DBM used up the entire P27.35 billion in the special account in the general fund, from just 12.6 percent in releases in January. Last month, the DBM likewise disbursed the complete P480,000 allocation for the pension of former presidents or their widows. For two months now, the DBM has yet to release any amount from the P848.03 billion for interest payments, as well as the P28.7 billion for net lending. As early as January, the agency had released the entire P1.03 trillion for the national tax allotment and the full P83.42 billion for the block grant. The DBM also freed up the entire P68.55 billion in retirement and life insurance premiums of state workers in January and added some P5.61 billion in extra funds last month. Further, the DBM recorded P25.68 billion in other releases as of February, 87 percent or P22.4 billion of which went to other automatic appropriations. There was also P1.1 billion released for unprogrammed appropriations. Unprogrammed appropriations provide standby authority to incur additional agency obligations for priority programs or projects when revenue collection exceeds targets or when additional grants or foreign funds are generated. The entire P1.1 billion was allocated to support the foreign-assisted projects of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority.",https://www.philstar.com/business/2025/03/15/2428412/p423-trillion-released-2025-budget
"Senate must have safeguard vs unconstitutional items in 2025 budget, says lawmaker","MANILA, Philippines — Opposition lawmaker Sen. Risa Hontiveros said the Senate must include safeguards in the 2025 budget to prevent items from being deemed unconstitutional. During the Senate’s plenary session on the 2025 National Expenditure Program on Wednesday, November 7, Hontiveros posed a challenge to Sen. Grace Poe, the 2025’s budget sponsor and the Chair of the Senate Committee on Finance. “If we consider the possible constitutional breach of the GAA (General Appropriations Act), programmed and unprogrammed, that exceeds the NEP, is it possible that the sponsor and the Chair of the Finance Committee to make a resolution, and a general provision that the principle of the GAA not exceeding the NEP (National Expenditure Program) will be followed?” Hontiveros said in Filipino. The NEP is the executive branch’s proposed version of the national budget. It then undergoes the legislative process and once finalized and signed by the president, it becomes the GAA. Throughout the year, the 2024 GAA raised eyebrows among lawmakers in the House of Representatives and the Senate. A major point of contention is the insertion of the P449.5 billion of unprogrammed funds into the 2024 GAA, in excess of the 2024 NEP.  The 2024 NEP only requested P281.9 billion. Hontiveros also asked Poe if she would introduce a provision that funds for projects certified by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) as priorities would not be diverted into unprogrammed funds. Budgets for several major items in the 2024 GAA were left in limbo after being redirected to unprogrammed funds. Some of these include the MRT LINE 4 Project, and the Metro Manila Subway Project. In principle, Poe agreed with Hontiveros, but the former offered no assurance. Poe said that she would look into it, particularly the projects under the Department of Public Works and Highways. “At the right time, all of us will have the chance to give suggestions whether these funds will be increased or decreased,” Poe said in Filipino. Another provision in the 2024 GAA that was raised was the line allowing the Department of Finance (DOF) to order the transfer of idle funds back into the national treasuries. The DOF ordered the return of P89.9 billion worth of idle Philhealth funds in three tranches back to the national coffers, much to the protest of several lawmakers and medical advocates. The matter has been brought to the Supreme Court, which has issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the final tranche. During the plenary session, Poe was questioned about the implications of this TRO. Poe said that the DOF will already comply with whatever the Supreme Court orders, but clarifies that the TRO does not mean that the previous two tranches will be returned. She said the final tranche is P30 billion. The said P30 billion was meant to fund transportation items but Poe said that the budget for these items has been put on hold following the TRO. However, Poe also said that these items could be funded by the national budget in the coming years. While it was ordered to transfer back funds, Philhealth has seemingly not been left wanting, with excess funds amounting to P500 billion. Senate President Francis Escudero also questioned Poe and the economic managers on their position on this excess. “Any surplus, while it may look good on the books, is actually money not well spent,” Escudero said. He added that with inflation on the rise, the value of that P500 billion could further depreciate if not used. Escudero also said that the value lowers by P20 billion a year. In a separate statement, Escudero said that the P500 billion could be used for climate change mitigation measures.",https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2024/11/07/2398381/senate-must-have-safeguard-vs-unconstitutional-items-2025-budget-says-lawmaker

"Quimbo: P6.325 trillion budget legal, bicam report contained correction","The proposed P6.325 trillion budget for 2025 is lawful and enforceable even as the Bicameral Conference Report had corrected/adjusted entries, acting House appropriations panel chairperson Stella Quimbo said Monday. Quimbo, a Marikina City representative, said she issued the statement to reaffirm the statements made by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman and Senate President Francis Escudero. These officials issued such statements after former President Rodrigo Duterte and his allies alleged that the President signed a defective budget bill for 2025 since it was based on a Bicameral Conference Reportcontaining blank items. ""The Bicameral Report explicitly authorized the technical secretariats of both the Senate and the House of Representatives to implement corrections and adjustments as required. These do not affect the integrity nor the legality of the budget,"" Quimbo said. ""The 2025 General Appropriations Act is lawful, valid, and fully enforceable. The enrolled General Appropriations Bill [which the President signed into law] is complete, with no blank allocations among its more than 235,000 line items,"" Quimbo added. When the members of the Bicameral Committee including herself signed the report, Quimbo said all appropriations had already been determined and approved, meaning no changes were made. ""The enrolled General Appropriations Bill has been made publicly available, providing the best evidence of its completeness and compliance with due process. Makikita po ng lahat ito. Walang tinatago,"" Quimbo said. (You can see everything. There is nothing here.) ""Any suggestion of impropriety is unfounded and appears to be politically motivated rather than prompted by genuinely substantive concerns. It is unfortunate that an administrative matter is being maliciously misconstrued to create controversy where there is none,"" Quimbo added. In closing, Quimbo said discussions on the matter should end given the comprehensive explanation. ""This matter has been sufficiently explained, and at a time when we face far real and urgent national challenges, it would be more productive to focus our efforts on addressing the legitimately pressing needs of our people,"" Quimbo added.

Ungab said there were missing budget amounts for items under the Department of Agriculture and unprogrammed appropriations. Reacting to Ungab's findings, Duterte said that budget items should not be left empty “to be filled up later on.'' Marcos then said Duterte was ""lying"" when he made the allegations. ''He’s lying.

Quimbo confirms blanks in budget bicam report but says funding already identified,"House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations acting chairperson Stella Quimbo on Monday confirmed that there were blank items in the bicameral report on the P6.325 trillion national budget for 2025. But she quickly added that funding for these items had been identified before the signing of the report. According to Jonathan Andal's report on ""24 Oras,"" Quimbo was asked if she acknowledges that there are blanks in the bicameral conference report on the budget signed by lawmakers. “Yes. Notwithstanding any typographical errors or any adjustments that are needed as a result of amendments, ay authorized naman po ang technical staff ng both House and Senate to make all of these necessary corrections,” Quimbo said. But despite having blank items, she said that the funding for each item in the budget was already identified before the members of the bicameral conference committee had signed the report. “Lahat ng naging corrections ng ating technical staff, lahat po ‘yan ay ministerial na lang. Ibig sabihin calculator activity na lang po. Wala na po silang discretion, dahil lahat po ay decided na by the bicam members at the point of signing,” she said. (All the corrections made by our technical staff were only ministerial. This means that only calculator activities were done. They did not have any discretion because everything was already decided by the bicam members at the point of signing.) According to the omnibus motion in the bicam report, the technical staff of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance are “authorized to effect corrections of typographical, grammatical and printing errors, as well as necessary adjustments such as performance indicators and section number of general and special provisions as a consequence  of the amendments.” It added that in case of conflict between the bicameral conference committee report and the printed version of the bill, the latter shall prevail. But when asked if filling the blanks with certain amounts is considered a typographical error, Quimbo replied: “There are some typographical errors. Dahil ‘yung iba doon ay makikita naman eh (Because some of them can be seen in the bill).” Further, Quimbo said that there were no more blank items in the enrolled bill which was signed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. “It is legal, it is fully enforceable, it is valid. Dahil po ang ating enrolled bill, ibig sabihin po ang General Appropriations Bill na nanggaling po sa Congress, ay kumpleto, walang blank. So, that's basically the reason for why ang naging basehan ng GAA ay kumpleto din,” she said. (It is legal, it is fully enforceable, it is valid. Because the enrolled bill, the General Appropriations Bill that came from Congress is complete, has no blanks. So that’s basically the reason why the basis for the GAA is also complete.) In a separate statement, Quimbo said that any criticisms on the national budget is mere politicking. “Any suggestion of impropriety is unfounded and appears to be politically motivated rather than prompted by genuinely substantive concerns.

Marcos wants 'critical projects' in NEP be restored in 2025 budget,"President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. on Tuesday said he wants government agencies to reexamine the administration’s programs contained in the National Expenditure Program (NEP) but were defunded by Congress. Marcos said he wants government agencies to focus particularly on those considered critical to his administration's socioeconomic programs. “We have to reexamine so that the programs that we wanted – that we put in the NEP -- can somehow be restored,” Marcos said during the 18th Cabinet Meeting in Malacañang Palace. “For the rest of the departments, I need you to give me the priorities  – the things that we prioritized in the NEP that were removed in terms of budgeting, in terms of appropriations,” he added. “So, what are those? In each department, what are those that are absolutely critical to the socioeconomic program as we delivered to the Congress? Paano natin ibabalik kasi critical ‘yung mga program na nawala.'' [How can we return them since they are critical programs.] Marcos said he is willing to sit down with each department to ensure that the government’s actual expenditure program will resemble the NEP. He said many things have to be addressed, including the P12-billion decrease in the budget for the maintenance of roads, P500-million reduction in the funding for routine maintenance of bridges and the P21-billion budget cut for feasibility studies. Marcos signed into law the proposed national budget for fiscal year 2025 on December 30 and said that he directly vetoed over P194 billion worth of line items that are not consistent with his administration's priorities, including some programs of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). In his veto message, Marcos said ''the aim of this Administration in our Medium-Term Fiscal Program is to ensure that government targets will respond more directly to the needs of the Filipino people as strategic growth-enhancing fiscal consolidation is pursued.''— RSJ, GMA Integrated News",https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/932100/marcos-wants-critical-projects-in-nep-be-restored-in-2025-budget/story/

3 senators deny there were blank entries in 2025 budget bicam report,"Three senators on Tuesday denied that the bicameral conference committee report on the 2025 national budget had blank entriesas claimed by former President Rodrigo Duterte. Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada said he doesn't think that it is possible for the bicam report to contain blank entries. ""I don't think so,"" Estrada said in an ambush interview. ""Wala akong napansin,"" he added. (I didn't notice anything.) Senators Sherwin Gatchalian and Joel Villanueva, who were both part of the bicameral conference committee on the 2025 General Appropriations Bill, said  there were no blank entries in the report.

It's what we were always monitoring. I have a whole team that looks through the budget before I sign.) ""Kasi kung blangko, hindi magbabalanse eh. Kailangan balanse ang budget eh.

(It's hard to believe there would be blanks because then it wouldn't tally and at the same time, that law cannot be passed with blanks. That is my view.) While he made the remark, Villanueva said he is not closing his doors to the ""rumors"" on some items in the 2025 national budget. ""Kung totoo man 'yung sinasabi na may mga blanko, siguro ang maaari o posibleng mangyari is lump sum o may lump sum.

Hontiveros said that she and Senate Minority Leader Koko Pimentel registered negative votes on the bicam report last December to oppose the zero subsidy for the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), and the budget cuts for Department of Education (DepEd) and the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps). ""Pero naman, hindi ako makapaniwala na kahit aling Kongreso natin, pati 'yung amin ngayon, ay magpapasa ng isang panukalang batas o General Appropriations Act na may blanko pa na linya,"" she said in an Unang Balita interview.

Senators Jinggoy Estrada, Sherwin Gatchalian, and Joel Villanuevahave also denied that the bicam report on the 2025 national budget had blank entries as claimed by Duterte. Kabataan Rep. Raoul Manuel, meanwhile, showed a copy of the bicam report that seemingly has parts that are blank or vacant. He said that these were similar to what Duterte and Ungab revealed earlier. Manuel said that the bicam report, which copy was obtained by GMA Integrated News, was the same document ratified by the Congress in December, based on a 24 Oras report of Jonathan Andal. The solon recalled that a soft copy of the report was only emailed to lawmakers one week before the ratification and its printed copy was provided one hour before it was brought to the plenary. Manuel admitted that lawmakers were not able to properly scrutinize the bicam report due to lack of time. “Sobrang ipit ng oras talaga para mabusisi ‘yan… On my end din, sa totoo lang, hindi rin agad nakita ‘yung mga blanks kasi nga hindi tayo sanay eh na may mga ganoon,” Manuel lamented. (We were really pressed for time to check the entire report... On my end too, honestly, I was not able to see the blank parts immediately because we were not used to seeing such.) “Ngayon ko lang na-encounter na nag-ratify ng budget, mayroon palang mga blanks,” he added. (It was my first time to encounter a ratification of the budget that has blank entries.) The solon also questioned who filled the blanks in the bicam report after it was ratified. “After ratification, saka bago pirmahan, sino ‘yung nag-fill in the blanks? So, dapat may sumagot diyan. At ang pwede lang makasagot, ang mga bahagi ng bicam saka ‘yung Pangulo,” he said. (After ratification and before its signing into law, who filled in the blanks? Someone should answer that. The only one who can answer that are those who are part of the bicam, and the President.)— VDV/RF, GMA Integrated News",https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/933695/hontiveros-blank-entries-2025-budget-wala-akong-nakita/story/
Engaging the Public in Participatory National Budget Process," Engaging the Public in Participatory National Budget Process Novel V. Bangsal19 December 2024 The national government budget serves a number of development objectives, namely: 1) stabilizing the economy; 2) redistributing income, and 3) providing social assistance to vulnerable groups. In addition to being a development tool, the budget is also an instrument for public accountability. By identifying revenue sources and expenditures, the budget enables citizens to see if public funds are being spent for their intended purpose. The transparency of budget information fosters trust between the government and its constituency, resulting to more informed public discourse about fiscal policies and priorities. Thus, this commentary examines how public participation impacts the national budget process, discusses the challenges faced, and explores the potential for improved participation to create a more responsive and accountable government. Budget reforms on citizen participation The budget process reflects the power relations between the branches of government in making budget decisions. It is important to note the budget process is divided into four stages, namely: preparation, legislation, execution, and accountability. For instance, budget preparation is the purview of the executive, and budget legislation belongs to Congress. The executive takes the lead again in the execution stage, while the Commission on Audit assumes control over budget accountability. Each stage offers opportunities for engagement between the government and the public in general, following formal rules of the budget legal framework or informal rules based on traditions and exchanges. Entry points for citizen participation typically occur at multiple stages, especially during budget preparation and legislation. However, opportunities in these stages are often informal andad hocin nature. The lack of formal consultations mechanisms suggests that it is quite difficult for the public to directly participate in the budget process, and exert influence towards more responsive and inclusive fiscal policies. To address this gap, several legislative measures have been filed to institutionalize the participation of civil society organizations (CSOs) in the budget process. Furthermore, the budget process is not only a dynamic system but also a political arena for competing interests. This transactional mode determines who gets what, when, and how the money is spent. However, the real question is whether the politics that largely influence the budget process can lead to desirable fiscal outcomes such as fiscal discipline and efficiency in allocation and operation. Historically, the budget process has been viewed as an unwieldy and exclusive undertaking reserved for government, often resulting in a wide disparity between public spending and the actual needs of the community. This observation finds credence from the lectures of Dr. Ma. Victoria Raquiza of the UP National College of Public Administration and Governance and Undersecretary Rolando Toledo of the Department of Budget and Management during the CBILLS Thursday Talks at the Development Academy of the Philippines. Dr. Raquiza underlined the sustained engagement between the Social Watch Philippines and members of Philippine Congress through the Alternative Budget Initiative. Moreover, Undersecretary Toledo highlighted major budget reforms since 2010, namely: 1) the Principles of Constructive Engagement with CSOs; and, 2) the Budget Partnership Agreements between agencies and CSOs. On account of these relevant gains, the Philippines has topped other Asian countries in the Open Budget Index on public engagement. Challenges to citizen participation in the budget process Despite the progress made, several challenges hinder meaningful citizen participation in the budget process. One of the key barriers is the lack of public awareness and understanding of how government budgets are formulated, implemented, and monitored. While the government is mandated to disclose budget documents, these documents are too complex and technical—not to mention their voluminous sizes, making it hard for ordinary citizens to comprehend nor do these documents reveal enough information as to the authorities’ goals or priorities. Second, access to information is often limited. Bureaucratic red tape impedes the timely dissemination of information, further discouraging citizens to provide feedback on the resource allocation. Third, corruption and patronage politics pose significant challenges. In some instances, budget decisions may be influenced by political considerations rather than genuine community needs. This practice undermines trust in the process and dissuades citizen engagement. To counter these issues, there must be robust mechanisms for public accountability and budget oversight, ensuring that public funds are spent judiciously and efficiently to deliver desired outcomes. And fourth, the fragmentation of efforts across different government agencies can impede coordinated citizen engagement. While various departments promote participation, a lack of synergy can lead to confusion and disorganization. Establishing a cohesive approach for citizen engagement helps build consensus around budget decisions. Role of ICT in facilitating citizen participation In the digital age, technology adds new dimension to citizen participation in the budget process. Online platforms and mobile applications can facilitate the process of gathering inputs, making it easier for individuals to voice their opinions and monitor budget utilization. As digital literacy improves, leveraging technology will become more essential in empowering people to take greater control of the budget agenda for deliberation. However, enhancing citizen participation in the budget process involves more than just collecting feedback; it’s about fostering a culture of accountability and shared responsibility. By involving citizens in the decision-making process, the government can better align its fiscal policies with the needs and aspirations of its community. Social media also plays a pivotal role in raising awareness about budget issues and mobilizing public engagement. Government agencies can use such platforms to disseminate information about the budget process, share updates on public consultations, and encourage citizen participation. By utilizing technology, the government can reach a broader audience and facilitate more inclusive discussions about budget priorities. Building a Culture of Participation It is crucial to foster a culture of engagement. Authorities must be willing to listen to and act upon the feedback they receive, creating a feedback loop that reinforces the importance of citizen engagement. Education and capacity-building initiatives are vital in this regard. By enabling citizens, they can become more effective advocates for their communities. There are a number of activities that can help provide ample spaces for more direct citizen participation, such as: Conclusion The state of citizen participation in the national budget process underscores both the progress made and the challenges that persist. While improvements in budget transparency and initiatives have created opportunities for engagement, some barriers hinder the effective participation of the public. By addressing these challenges and implementing further budget reforms, authorities can foster a more inclusive and responsive budget process, leading to better governance and improved outcomes for citizens. On this note, the DBM should be commended for makingbudget documents more accessible for better citizen engagement. The increasing size of National Expenditure Program (NEP) documents signifies the government’s efforts to make the budget information more transparent. This move intends to provide a more granular and detailed presentation of the budget allocations instead of resorting to lump-sum appropriations. It is a positive step to present budget information in a clear and understandable format, utilizing visual aids, and plain language. This will help demystify the budget process and encourage more citizens to engage in its various stages. Overall, a more engaged public is essential for a thriving democracy, and meaningful participation in the budget process is a crucial step toward achieving desired fiscal outcomes.

He urged members to come out with a final version of the budget that prioritizes the needs of the Filipino people.(Photo courtesy of the House Press and Public Affairs Bureau) MANILA– Speaker Martin Romualdez on Thursday called on the bicameral conference committee (bicam) to prioritize Filipinos in the 2025 national budget and produce a spending plan that addresses their daily needs. “We’re all here because we’ve been trusted with a responsibility. Let’s live up to that trust. Let’s have honest, productive discussions, and let’s find the common ground that puts the people first,” Romualdez said at the bicam’s first meeting. “We owe it to every Filipino who wakes up every day trying to make ends meet, hoping that their government has their back. Let’s give them a budget that says, ‘Yes, we hear you. Yes, we care. And yes, we’re doing something about it,’” he added. Romualdez said the bicam should not complicate its budget deliberations to reconcile the versions of the House of Representatives and the Senate. “Let’s keep things practical and straightforward. We don’t need to overcomplicate this. Let’s focus on what will make the biggest difference for the Filipino people. The programs that matter, the services they rely on, and the investments that will move this country forward — those should be non-negotiable,” he said. Romualdez reminded the bicam members of the gravity of their task, noting that the budget’s impact ""has the power to either improve or disrupt the lives of millions of Filipinos.” “This is no ordinary task. We’re not just crunching numbers; we’re crafting solutions to real problems faced by real people every single day,” he stressed. Romualdez noted that the House ensured its budget version reflects key priorities, including food affordability, job creation, accessible healthcare, improved education, and disaster preparedness. “We focused on what’s urgent: keeping food prices down, creating jobs, making healthcare accessible, improving education, and ensuring disaster preparedness,” he said. “I am confident that our colleagues in the Senate share these goals.” Romualdez expressed optimism that the bicam could bridge the gap between legislative chambers and deliver solutions to pressing needs. “This is where we prove that we’re capable of working together, not just as representatives of our respective chambers but as leaders who genuinely care about the future of this country,"" he said. While the two chambers have differing approaches, he highlighted the shared goal of creating an inclusive budget. “The outcome must be the same: a budget that works for everyone — from the farmers in rural provinces to the workers in urban centers, from small business owners to young students dreaming of a better life,” he said. “I know we can get this done, and I know we can do it right. So let’s get to work,” Romualdez said. Lifeblood Meanwhile, House Appropriations Committee chairperson Elizaldy Co highlighted the budget’s critical role in sustaining government operations and advancing essential services. ""This budget is the lifeblood of our nation. It enables government to operate effectively and deliver essential services to the Filipino people,"" Co said. Co said the proposed budget also ensures continuing progress under the Marcos administration’s eight-point socioeconomic agenda, which aims to lower the poverty rate to a single digit and elevate the country’s status to an upper-middle-income economy. “The Official Poverty Statistics for 2023 show a compelling narrative of progress. Poverty incidence has fallen to 15.5 percent, a significant improvement from 18.1 percent in 2021. This means 2.45 million Filipinos were lifted out of poverty in the last two years,” Co said. Co further noted that the number of food-poor individuals declined from 6.5 million in 2021 to 4.484 million in 2023, reflecting the direct benefits of socioeconomic initiatives supported in the budget. “These figures speak loudly of the changes in the lives of many poor Filipinos. They are direct beneficiaries of the initiatives and socio-economic programs we supported in this budget. They represent lives changed, families given hope, and communities strengthened,” Co said. Co emphasized the budget’s role in addressing inflation, climate change impacts, and providing hope to vulnerable sectors. “By continuing the socio-economic programs and infrastructure investments in this budget, we will profoundly impact every Filipino battling inflation and the impact of calamities brought by climate change,” he said. “More importantly, this budget will bring hope and optimism to vulnerable sectors that look to us for leadership and support.” As the bicam deliberations progress, Co urged lawmakers to reconcile their differences and align efforts with the administration’s priorities. “Let us seize this opportunity to shape the legacy of our collective work—one that reflects our shared commitment to build a stronger, more equitable, more resilient Philippines,” Co said.(PNA) ",https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1238951

PHL’s 2025 budget law faces legal challenges,"THE PHILIPPINES’ P6.326-trillion budget this year faces legal hurdles due to unresolved issues stemming from priority allocations and allegedly shady legislative maneuvers in its drafting last year, analysts said at the weekend. A legal victory for its critics could jeopardize Philippine growth prospects, they added. “The approved budget for 2025 is evidently driven by the need to appease politicians rather than to address genuine needs of the Filipino people,” former Finance Undersecretary Cielo D. Magno said in a Facebook Messenger chat. “This explains the clearly unconstitutional acts that have been woven into the budget.” Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. signed into law the 2025 General Appropriations Act on Dec. 30 but vetoed P194 billion worth of line items that he said were inconsistent with his government’s priorities. These include appropriations for certain programs of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and unprogrammed funds that increased four times, he said. The budget was again put in the spotlight in mid-January after his predecessor Rodrigo R. Duterte said the budget bill had blank line items whose amounts were later filled out by the Executive branch. Mr. Marcos has accused the tough-talking leader of peddling a lie. The blank line items contained in the budget were to projects under the Agriculture department, such as irrigation and farm-to-market roads, according to a copy of the budget’s bicameral conference committee report obtained byBusinessWorld. “If there is truth in the allegation that there were blank items in the bicameral version of the General Appropriations bill, then this will be another ground to question its legality,” Ephraim B. Cortez, president of National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, said in a Viber message. “This means that the bill was not complete when it was finally approved by Congress.” Ms. Magno said changing the version of the budget bill approved by lawmakers is prohibited. “There are no additions or amendments that can be made after this point.” The Philippine Senate and House of Representatives ratified the budget bill on Dec. 11, hours after the bicameral conference committee members reconciled their differences. “After the conference committee has reconciled the provisions for the Senate and House versions of a bill, it signs the report that becomes the basis for the General Appropriations Act,” she pointed out. “Congress could not have legally filled in any blanks because the legislative process ended after both Houses ratified the reconciled version,” she said. “The Executive branch could not have filled in the blanks either because appropriation is a legislative function.” Congress should publish the enrolled bill of the budget so the public could check whether there were really blank items, she added. “Once a bill becomes an enrolled bill, then no changes can be made to it,” Michael Henry Ll. Yusingco, a constitutionalist and senior research fellow at the Ateneo Policy Center, said in a Facebook Messenger chat. “Any change done to an enrolled bill which later becomes law will make this law unconstitutional.” He added that Mr. Marcos’ certification of the budget bill as urgent was invalid in the absence of a public emergency or calamity. Civic groups have flagged issues hounding the 2025 budget including allegations that funding for public works dwarfed the budget for education. “The budget violates the constitutional mandate that the state should give priority to education,” Mr. Cortez said. GROWTH RISKThe law allotted P1 trillion for the education sector, 4.3% higher than the P1.007-trillion funding for the DPWH. “While it appears that the education sector got the biggest budget allocation of P1.055-trillion… they included in the education budget the allocations for institutions not considered part of basic or tertiary education,” Mr. Cortez said, referring to military and police academies. “They lumped them with the education budget to make it appear that it got the highest allocation in the 2025 budget,” he added. The budget law also violated the 2019 Universal Healthcare Act and Sin Tax Reform Act of 2012, which could also be grounds for its unconstitutionality, according to Filomeno S. Sta. Ana III, Action for Economic Reform coordinator. Lawmakers scrapped P74 billion in state subsidies for the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth), citing its ample reserve funds. “The revenues from tobacco, e-cigarette and sweetened beverage excise taxes are exclusively and strictly for PhilHealth,” he said in a Viber message. The Philippine government would likely re-enact the 2024 national budget should the Supreme Court void the 2025 spending plan, Ms. Magno said. “This does not preclude congress from enacting another budget, hopefully one that is free from constitutional doubt,” she added. Voiding the budget law could dampen Philippine economic growth, Michael L. Ricafort, chief economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., said in a Viber message. “A bigger risk over the past 10 to 20 years has been a re-enacted budget since this would mean lower government spending than was originally planned, which could slow domestic product growth,” he toldBusinessWorld. The government targets 6% to 8% economic growth this year. A re-enacted budget could cut funding for infrastructure, education and key government priority programs, he added. It could also disrupt state operations, affecting industries that rely on public spending, John Paolo R. Rivera, a senior research fellow at the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, said in a Viber message. “Investor confidence would likely be disturbed, as questions about governance, transparency and adherence to constitutional processes will emerge, leading to potential capital flight, a weaker Philippine peso and reduced foreign direct investments,” he added. The “political capture” of the national budget should be fixed with more transparency and accountability, more responsible decision-making and oversight by a Congress with more integrity, Jose Enrique “Sonny” A. Africa, executive director at think tank IBON Foundation, said in a Viber message. Civic groups should also be allowed to have a say in the crafting of the budget, Renato B. Magtubo, a former congressman and chairman of Partido Manggagawa, said via Viber. “There should be a sectoral consultation to address budget issues or concerns.”",https://www.pids.gov.ph/details/news/in-the-news/phl-s-2025-budget-law-faces-legal-challenges
"Ping Lacson confirms blank items in 2025 budget bicam report, questions senators’ silence","Former Senator Panfilo Lacson is dismayed by senators’ silence over the blank items in the bicameral conference committee report of the 2025 national budget, whose existence he confirmed. Lacson said there were 13 pages in the 200-page bicam report which contained blanks beside the funding for Department of Agriculture projects, such as fisheries, coconuts, seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation. “I saw at least the bicam report of the Senate is not the same as the report of the House of Representatives. There may be really blank spaces there seems to be 12-13 pages out of the 200 pages of the report,” Lacson said in an explainer on Saturday (Jan. 25). “I think most of the blanks are appropriations in the DA. Meron in the Philippine Coconut Authority, Fisheries, Office of the Secretary. I saw it myself because I was sent a copy. At least 14 senators signed the bicam report with blanks. So even then the Senate bill has a problem because it is blank,” he added. The bicam report was signed by Senate President Francis Escudero, Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada, Majority Leader Francis Tolentino, Senate Finance Committee Chair Grace Poe, and Senators Cynthia Villar, Sherwin Gatchalian, Pia Cayetano, JV Ejercito, Joel Villanueva and Juan Michael Zubiri, and Mark Villar. For Lacson, the House of Representatives is the one to blame if it is proven that the blank items in the bicam report were filled out in the enrolled copy of the bill, which is printed by the lower House. Lacson added that Malacañang is to be blamed if it is the Department of Budget and Management which filled in the blanks before the President signed it into law as the General Appropriations Act. But for sure, his colleagues in the Senate shared the blame for not continuing the Senate’s tradition of calling out irregularities in the budget, Lacson said. “It’s easy to see it so we can pinpoint the responsibility. Always compare the ratified bicam report with the enrolled bill. If the same is true and there is a blank in the enrolled bill, everyone is guilty, both legislative and executive branch,” Lacson said. “But if the enrolled bill is filled up, there is no fault of Malacañang. The only fault is the House of Representatives and the Senate… There is a part in the Senate because it wasn’t pointed out. You want to have a blank one,” he added.",https://politiko.com.ph/2025/01/26/ping-lacson-confirms-blank-items-in-2025-budget-bicam-report-questions-senators-silence/politiko-lokal/

"FACT CHECK: NO ‘blank items’ in 2025 budget, Marcos NOT facing impeachment","Posts on social media are spreading the claim that there were irregularities such as blank figures in the 2025 General Appropriations Act (GAA) signed by President Ferdinand Marcos, and that this has led to an impeachment case. This is not true. The Facebook (FB) page of political commentator Jun Abines published one of the now-deleted spurious posts on Jan. 19. A part of it read: “The signed GAA of 2025 is an irrefutable evidence that Malacanang and Congress committed a heinous crime of defrauding the Filipino people through an illegal national budget with blank amounts that can easily be filled with hundreds of billions of pesos by anyone with no authority, no accountability and no identity. Many parts of the GAA 2025 are technically blank checks!” “The signed GAA of 2025 is an irrefutable evidence that Malacanang and Congress committed a heinous crime of defrauding the Filipino people through an illegal national budget with blank amounts that can easily be filled with hundreds of billions of pesos by anyone with no authority, no accountability and no identity. Many parts of the GAA 2025 are technically blank checks!” Two days later, a YouTube channel posted a 42-minute video with the narrator saying that Marcos is facing impeachment over the “illegal signing” of the 2025 GAA. It bore the headline: “KAKAPASOK LANG Het0 Go0dNews! PBBM Impeachment Isusul0ng na? mga Pumirmang Alip0res Pakakas0han din(Just in. This is good news! Marcos’ impeachment going to happen? Others who signed will also be charged)?” “KAKAPASOK LANG Het0 Go0dNews! PBBM Impeachment Isusul0ng na? mga Pumirmang Alip0res Pakakas0han din(Just in. This is good news! Marcos’ impeachment going to happen? Others who signed will also be charged)?” These claims are false. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) cleared up the confusion on the allegations. The president is also not facing any impeachment charges nor are there any officials that publicly announced their intention to file an impeachment case against him. DBM said in aJan. 20 statement: “These allegations are false and reckless.” “What has been presented by certain misinformed individuals are pages from the Bicameral Conference Committee Report, and NOT the General Appropriations Bill (GAB) nor the GAA,” it read. DBM also added that the bill – and not the bicameral report – is the document officially submitted to the president for approval or veto, as mandated by the 1987 Constitution. “To reiterate, the Bill presented to and signed by the President is a complete document, with no blank pages or missing details. In no case does the Executive issue a GAA with blank pages or figures,” it added. Another similar post made on Abines’ FB page was debunked by VERA Files Fact Check earlier this week, where we alsoconfirmedthat the 4,057-page GAA for the fiscal year of 2025, or Republic Act No. 12116, did not contain any “blank pages.” The full copy of the 2025 GAA is publicly available and can be accessed online via DBM’sofficial website.

The government had finalized the UP system’s 2023 budget before the protests shown in the video took place and only reduced it by P128.4 million, not P2.5 billion.

The video started with a clip from Tinig ng Plaridel’stweetshowing students hounding Edgardo Carlo Vistan II after he was appointed as the 12th UP Diliman Chancellor on April 3.

DBM: Not privy to bicam report,"The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) said it was not aware of the blank pages in the Bicameral Conference Committee (Bicam) report that was the basis for the 2025 General Appropriations Act that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed on 30 December. Budget Undersecretary Goddes Hope Libiran disputed this newspaper’s editorial, “Blank Wall,” saying the DBM was not privy to the supposed blank pages in the Bicam report. The basis of the editorial, however, was a DBM statement that said in part, “What has been presented by certain misinformed individuals are pages from the Bicameral Conference Committee Report, and NOT the General Appropriations Bill (GAB) nor the GAA.” Allow us to note that nowhere in the released DBM statement did “the budget chief acknowledge the discrepancies” involving the 2025 GAA which allegedly contained blank pages or figures, Libiran said. “What the DBM pointed out was that the documents under scrutiny were from a copy of the Bicameral Conference Committee report, and not the General Appropriations Bill nor the GAA or the enacted national budget approved by President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.,” she said. The editorial, however, pointed out that the Bicam report with the blank items existed at the time that Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin said it was merely invented by whistleblower Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab. “This, however, does not in any way translate into a concession made by the DBM chief. What we are certain of is that the enrolled bill signed by the President contained no blank pages. This can be verified in the copy of the GAA uploaded on our website on 3 January 2025,” according to Libiran. “We would like to emphasize that the DBM statement was made in response to misleading posts by some individuals, especially by one Jun Abines which garnered more than 300,000 reactions as of this writing and nearly 200,000 shares which falsely claimed that the GAA had 10 or more blank pages,” she said. “Hidden in the 222 pages of the 2025 General Appropriations Acts (GAA) were at least 10 pages with blank spaces where the amount of the budget was supposed to be written. “Now we learn that of the P6.3-trillion 2025 GAA budget, there were loopholes and blank spaces that would allow them to put in the desired amount and redirect those funds to whoever, wherever and whenever they want! “(Budget Secretary Amenah) Pangandaman should provide a clear response to questions about the huge unfilled spaces, a mystery that remains unresolved with the DBM’s obscure statement,” the editorial said. It was Ungab and former President Rodrigo Duterte in a viral podcast who blew the lid off the Bicam report that was peppered with missing texts. Ask Congress The details of the process of legislation at the Congress level are best explained by Congress itself, Libiran said. “The Bicam committee also has its internal rules of procedure on the matter of legislation. Hence, the Bicam members are in the best position to shed light on this matter,” she said in a letter to Daily Tribune. “We implore the author to refrain from spreading disinformation and negative prejudice, especially to a government official, in his/her coverage and reporting,” the letter stated. “It would be unfortunate if the consequences of disseminating inaccurate information would undermine the untainted integrity of Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, who works tirelessly to the best of her ability as an honest and true public servant,” it went. “Such actions would likewise demonstrate an imprudent disregard for accurate and fair information — a potential risk that would eclipse quality journalism,” the letter said.",https://tribune.net.ph/2025/01/25/dbm-not-privy-to-bicam-report
"Marcos signs 2025 budget, vetoes items inconsistent with admin priorities","Ten days after the original date of the signing of the national budget for 2025, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has enacted the General Appropriations Act (GAA), or Republic Act 12116. The GAA sets the budget that will be spent by the government for Fiscal Year 2025. This includes projects, operational expenses, and other programs. The original submitted budget proposal was P6.352 trillion, but the passed budget was reduced to P6.326 trillion after Marcos directly vetoed line items “that are not consistent with the country’s development plan and responsive to the needs of the people.” “After an exhaustive and thorough review, we have directly vetoed over P194 billion worth of line items that are not consistent with our programmed priorities. These include allocations for certain programs and projects of the Department of Public Works and Highways, and those under the Unprogrammed Appropriations, which increased by 300 percent,” he said. In addition, the government will pursue a “Conditional implementation” of certain items that utilize the national budget. This includes the implementation of theAyuda sa Kapos ang KitaProgram or AKAP, as it would need guidelines in order to be properly implemented. Earlier, AKAP became a concern as it could lead to misuse of funds, especially since the 2025 midterm elections are right around the corner. Marcos said guidelines for the implementation of AKAP will be “strategic leading to the long-term improvement of the lives of qualified beneficiaries, while guarding against misuse and duplication and fragmented benefits.” “This approach is anchored on a simple yet profound truth: the appropriation of public funds must not break the public trust,” he stressed. In addition to AKAP, other programs are also subject to Conditional Implementation, such as the DSWD-OSEC special provisions on thePayapa at Masaganang PamayananProgram (PAMANA), the definition of the basic infrastructure program under the DPWH OSEC, the payment of retirement benefits and pension under the Office of the Ombudsman, and other special provisions. Prior to the budget signing, lawmakers and stakeholders called on Marcos to return the budget proposal to Congress and reenact the 2024 budget for next year. The Chief Executive disagreed with this suggestion, saying it would set the country back and hamper economic growth. “This is not an option that we can afford. A reenacted budget will set us back, delay our vital programs, jeopardize targets for economic growth, including our goals of achieving single-digit poverty levels, and upper-middle-income status,” he stressed. Shortly after the budget signing, Marcos’ economic team hosted a press conference explaining the process behind the President’s decision. Over the holidays, Marcos met his economic team multiple times to comb through the budget proposal line by line. Among those he met with were Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, Finance Secretary Ralph Recto, Public Works and Highways Secretary Manuel Bonoan, and National Economic and Development Authority Secretary Arsenio Balisacan. The team listed the vetoed items in the 2025 budget, explaining that these did not align with the priorities of the administration. According to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), P26 billion from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) was directly vetoed, as well as P168 billion worth of unprogrammed appropriations. For his part, DPWH Secretary Bonoan said that the projects affected by the President’s veto are “not totally supportive of the eight-point socio-economic agenda of the government” and need to be scrutinized before implementation. “These are some of the projects are not ready for implementation at this point in time. So, these are projects that we have deferred actually,” he said. One notable point of contention in the budget was the allocation of funds across priority sectors. While the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) received a larger budget than DepEd, the broader education sector, including the Commission on Higher Education and other agencies and state universities and colleges (SUCs), received a total of P1.06T against the infrastructure agency's P1.01T. Pangandaman explained that the DepEd retained its budget, including its P12 billion budget cut. However, Pangandaman assured that if the DepEd needs additional funds in the coming fiscal year, the Department of Finance (DoF) can augment funds toward the government agency. P10 billion of the P12 billion slashed funds for DepEd was supposed to be used for the agency’s Computerization Program (DCP). Marcos previously vowed to reinstate the reduced budget to the department. The DBM maintained that there is no allocation for the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) in the GAA, as proposed by the bicameral committee. The bicameral committee, consisting of lawmakers from both the lower and upper chambers of Congress, did not allocate any funds to the state health insurer due to its surplus funds. Finance Secretary Ralph Recto supported Congress' decision, saying PhilHealth has sufficient operating funds. “Well, my understanding is that congress did that because the corporate operating budget of PhilHealth is sufficient. So, they have reserved funds of roughly P280 billion. They have a surplus of roughly P150 billion, the last time I looked at it. They have investments of more than P400 plus billion. They will earn P200 billion in 2025. They will spend P150 billion, so their surplus will increase by 50 billion. So, they have adequate resources,” he said. Recto vowed to monitor PhilHealth in 2025 and assist them in properly utilizing their budget. The national budget will be implemented starting 1 January 2025.",https://tribune.net.ph/2024/12/30/marcos-signs-2025-budget-vetoes-items-inconsistent-with-admin-priorities
DBM submits P6.352-T national budget to House,"ByKenneth Christiane L.Basilio THE DEPARTMENT of Budgetand Management (DBM) on Monday submitted to the House of Representatives its proposed P6.352-trillion national budget for 2025, which increases allocations for education by less than 1% and for defense by 6.4%, while more than doubling the budget for transportation. However, the DBM slashed the proposed budgets for agriculture, health and social welfare for next year. The proposed national budget is equivalent to 22.1% of gross domestic product, and 10.1% higher than the P5.768-trillion budget this year. “Education remains the top priority with P977.6 billion, equivalent to 15.4% of the budget, aligned with UNESCO’s (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) education 2030 framework for action,” Budget Secretary Amenah F. Pangandaman said during turnover ceremonies at the House. Next year’s proposed budget for the education sector inched up by 0.9% to P977.6 billion from P968.9 billion this year, according to a summary from the Budget department. This covers the Education department, Commission on Higher Education, Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and state universities. However, education’s share in the 2025 budget fell to 15.4%, compared with 16.8% this year. The allotted budget for the education sector is not on par with the 10% increase in the proposed 2025 budget and the country’s economic growth, Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said in a Viber message. “The P977.6 billion for education barely scratches the surface of the sector’s needs, especially considering the learning crisis exacerbated by the pandemic,” Party-list Rep. France L. Castro toldBusinessWorldin a Viber message. The government should ensure ample funding for more teaching positions to improve education quality, IBON Foundation Executive Director Jose Enrique A. Africa toldBusinessWorld. “The most glaring and most fundamentalflaw is that the number of teaching positions isn’t being increased, which means that those on the frontlines of teaching will be as overtasked and overburdened as ever,” he said in a Viber Message. The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) saw its budget fall by 9% to P900 billion. Of this, P226.7 billion will go to flood management projects, while P140.9 billion will be allotted for road network development. “The ‘Build Better More’ infrastructure program, through the Department of Public Works and Highways, will be allocated with P900 billion or 14.2% of the proposed budget to finance various public infrastructure [projects],” Ms. Pangandaman said. In the aftermath of the massive floods caused by Super Typhoon Carina last week, Terry L. Ridon, a public investment analyst and convenor of think tank InfraWatch PH, said Congress would have to tweak the infrastructure budget, particularly for proposed flood management projects. “Expert calls for more upland intervention such as dams might not have been reflected as yet in the current budget,” he said in a Viber message. On the other hand, next year’s budget for the Department of Transportation (DoTr) more than doubled to P180.9 billion from this year’s P73.9 billion. The increase is due to the need to “develop and modernize… the country’s infrastructure,” according to Ms. Pangandaman. The DoTr budget would fund key connectivity infrastructure such as the North-South Commuter Railway System and the first phase of the Metro Manila Subway project, she added. “Metro Manila Subway project Phase 1 is [allotted] P39.3 billion… while the North-South Commuter Railway Commuter System is [allocated] with almost P64 billion,” Ms. Pangandaman told reporters after the turnover ceremony. Meanwhile, the Defense budget will increase by 6.4% to P256.1 billion next year amid growing tensions with China over contested waters. The Philippine Army, Air Force, and Navy will collectively receive P204.4 billion under the proposed budget, while P50 billion will go to the Armed Forces’ modernization efforts, according to the Budget department’s summary. The increase in defense spending due to “escalating conflicts” with China is acceptable and shows the government is consistent in supporting the country’s efforts to modernize its military, Chester B. Cabalza, founding president of Manila-based International Development and Security Cooperation, toldBusinessWorld. “The AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) should emphasize wiser defense expenditure and effective procurement process to accelerate the frugal budget of the government,” he said in a Facebook Messenger chat. Rocio Salle Gatdula, a defense economist at the University of Asia and the Pacific, said the increased support for the military would help ensure it can counter China’s military capabilities. “The Philippines needs to continue investing the modernization of its armed forces. Additionally, it is important to maintain a thorough understanding of China’s weaponry to ensure the acquisition of appropriate defense equipment,” she said via Messenger chat. For the agriculture sector, the government is allotting P211.3 billion, 4.7% less than this year’s P221.7-billion funding. The budget will be used to fund the country’s agriculture modernization efforts and provide cash aid to farmers and fisherfolk. Of the amount proposed for the agriculture sector, P24.6 billion will go to irrigation services, P10 billion for the rice fund under a law that liberalized the rice industry and P2.8 billion for the agricultural credit program, according to the DBM’s summary. Next year’s funding for the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) stood at P230.1 billion, which is 7.6% lower than P248.1 billion in 2024.It will fund the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program and social pension for indigent senior citizens, said Ms. Pangandaman. The health sector, comprising the Health department and Philippine Health Insurance Corp., will receive P297.6 billion for next year’s proposed budget, 3.4% less than P308.3 billion this year.",https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2024/07/30/610922/dbm-submits-p6-352-t-national-budget-to-house/

Makabayan bloc wants budget bicam talks open to public,"LAWMAKERS belonging to the militant Makabayan bloc yesterday filed a resolution seeking to open the bicameral deliberations on the annual national budget to the media and the public, saying this would prevent both congressmen and senators from introducing insertions in the General Appropriations Bill (GAB). “The lack of transparency in bicameral conference committee proceedings has enabled the insertion in the budget law of provisions that were not in the versions approved by either house, and oftentimes not even discussed in the deliberations of either house, effectively circumventing proper legislative scrutiny,” the Makabayan bloc said in House Resolution No. 2067. The Makabayan bloc is composed of party-list Reps. France Castro (ACT), Arlene Brosas (Gabriela) and Raoul Manuel (Kabataan). The resolution cited as a “concrete” example of an insertion last year’s move of bicam members to amend the provisions of the 2024 GAB to amend Special Provision No. 1 on unprogrammed appropriations (UAs), which allowed government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) like Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) to be tapped as funding sources. “This basically allowed billions of pesos to be converted to UAs or diverted to the purposes (programs and projects) in the UAs, despite the fact they are ‘spoken for’ pursuant to the respective charters or governing laws of the GOCCs,” it said. The Makabayan bloc said the insertion, despite not being in both chambers’ approved versions of the bill, led to PhilHealth being required to remit P89.9 billion in excess subsidies to the National Treasury. Just last weekend, House leaders vowed to remain firm on retaining the P39 billion proposed budget for the Ayuda sa Kapos ang Kita Program (AKAP) of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in the proposed national budget for 2025 when they meet their Senate counterparts in the bicameral meetings. Senate minority leader Aquilino Pimentel III earlier said it would be best if the AKAP is deleted in the budget measure, saying its implementation lacks details. Pimentel said that the House only allegedly “inserted” the P39 billion funding for the AKAP in its version of the 2025 national budget. The resolution said the practice of the “Third Chamber” of introducing new provisions during bicameral conference meetings “undermines the democratic process and violates the principle that conference committees should limit themselves to reconciling differences between the two chambers’ versions.” “In effect, the closed-door ‘Third House’ overrules the decisions of the Lower House and the Senate, which are public as mandated by the Constitution,” said the militant lawmakers. They said public access to the proceedings of bicameral conference committees “will serve as a deterrent against questionable insertions and ensure that discussions remain within the scope of reconciling legitimate differences between the House and Senate versions.” “Transparency in budget deliberations is crucial in enabling citizen participation in governance, ensuring that public funds are appropriated in accordance with the people’s needs and interests, and assuring the right of the people to hold senators and congresspersons into account for their actions during the proceedings,” the resolution said. Meanwhile, Senate president pro tempore Jinggoy Estrada yesterday called on his colleagues to support the immediate passage of his bill calling for the abolition of the Optical Media Board (OMB), which he said has lost its legal mandate, Estrada noted that there are no more film pirates that the OMB can run after due to the “evolution of the digital technology.” “So, I think that was your main function before, yung OMB, hulihin lahat yung mga namimirata ng mga pelikula. So, ano na nga, what is now the duty or the function of this agency aide from arresting pirates? (So, I think that was your main function before, to arrest all film pirates. But what are the duties or functions of the agency now aside from arresting pirates?),” Estrada said as the Senate deliberated on the OMB’s proposed budget for next year. Sen. Mark Villar, who defended the agency’s budget, said OMB continues to protect and promote intellectual property rights through the exercise of its regulatory, enforcement and quasi-judicial functions. Villar said the OMB has also partnered with major telecommunications companies to educate the public against the proliferation of illicit streaming devices in both online and retail markets. He added that the agency also monitors the importation of storage devices “whether or not they allow to come into the country, that’s a majority what the work and checking for piracy.” “If there’s a bill because this agency was created by law, if there’s a bill that will also update and refresh the OMB, I think that’s something that we can support and look at,” Villar said. Sen. Ramon Revilla, who once headed the OMB, said abolishing the OMB will lead to its plantilla position employees to lose their jobs. Estrada said he filed Senate Bill No. 1904, which calls for the abolition of the OMB , since it no longer performs its primary mandate. “Kasi for me, wala nang function itong OMB. And I hope you will also agree with my position being the former chair of the OMB (For me, the OMB has no more function. And I hope you will agree with my position as former chair of the OMB),” Estrada said. He said the 52 employees can be absorbed by the Film Development Council of the Philippines. Also yesterday, Sen. Cynthia Villar urged the Department of Housing Settlement and Urban Development to reconsider its plan of constructing some 3.2 million medium-rise condominium units for the poor, saying the poor will not be able to afford the amortization of P2,600 a month for 30 years. Villar said the construction of condo units to solve the country’s housing backlog is not the solution. Instead, she said the DHSUD may want to give the poor an option of either owning a condo unit or give them lands which she said will only have a monthly amortization of P500 for 30 years. “They should be given the option to buy land or the condominium,” Villar said as the Senate tackled the DHSUD’s P6.3 billion proposed budget for 2025.– With Raymond Africa",https://malaya.com.ph/news/national-news/makabayan-bloc-wants-budget-bicam-talks-open-to-public/
"Senate staff drafted budget bicam report, says Quimbo","THE bicameral report on this year’s P6.326 trillion national budget which contained blank entries questioned by the camp of former President Rodrigo Duterte was prepared by the technical staff of the Senate Committee on Finance and not by the staff of the House of Representatives, Marikina City Rep. Stella Quimbo told reporters on Tuesday night. Quimbo, who is the acting chair of the House Committee on Appropriations, said: “So, ang nag-prepare po ay ang Senate technical staff ng Committee on Finance (So the one who prepared the bicam report was the Senate technical staff of the Committee on Finance.” The Senate finance committee is chaired by Sen. Grace Poe. Quimbo reiterated that the blanks – which is the subject of a Supreme Court petition filed by Duterte allies Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab and former executive secretary Victor Rodriguez – were only left as such pending final calculations to be made since lawmakers have already agreed on the exact figures during the bicameral meetings. Named as respondents in the petition were the House of Representatives headed by Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, Senate of the Philippines represented by Senate President Francis Escudero, and Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin. The petition asked the High Court to declare as unconstitutional Republic Act 12116, or the General Appropriations Act of 2025, which Ungab has said had missing allocations for certain items under the Department of Agriculture (DA) and unprogrammed appropriations in the bicameral report. The petitioners alleged the respondents committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when they signed the bicameral committee report on the 2025 national budget filled with blank spaces. The Ungab-Rodriguez petition also questioned the removal of the PhilHealth budget from the 2025 GAA, saying it “would have adverse effects upon the attainment of the Universal Health Care Act’s envisioned health system reforms.” They also claimed that the 2025 GAA violated Article VI, Section 25 (1) of the Constitution when the respondents realigned the proposed appropriations under the 2024 National Expenditure Program and in effect increased the appropriations for Congress and other line agencies. Quimbo, who earlier insisted that the 2025 GAA remains legal even if there were adjustments and corrections made in the bicameral level, said the act of filling out the blanks by the Senate staff to make the necessary adjustments was just ministerial. “We can see that these (adjustments) are based on the Senate committee report, also based on the House’s General Appropriations Bill (HGAB). Actually, you will also see some of the figures in other portions of the bicam report itself, as well as bicam discussions,” she said. Quimbo was senior vice chair of the House appropriations panel that deliberated on the 2025 budget and was one of the members of the House contingent to the bicameral meetings with senators. She was recently named the panel’s acting chair following the resignation of Rep. Zaldy Co (PL, Ako Bicol), who said he needed to focus on his health. Quimbo said it was also spelled out in the provisions of the bicameral report that in case there are discrepancies between the report and the printed version of the General Appropriations Bill (GAB), the printed version will be followed. “So, as I said yesterday (Monday), there are two omnibus provisions in our bicam report, and one of these states that in case of conflict between the bicam report and the printed version of the bill, the latter will prevail, which happened in this case because the bicam report had blanks and then the printed bill had figures. So, in that case, the printed bill prevails under the omnibus provision,” she explained. Quimbo last Monday said the bicameral report “explicitly authorized the technical secretariats of both the Senate and the House of Representatives to implement corrections and adjustments as required.” She said the changes do not affect the integrity or the legality of the budget bill because all appropriations had already been determined and approved and no changes were made after the members of the bicameral committee signed the report. In a separate interview, Ungab took exception to the claim of La Union Rep. Paolo Ortega V that their group filed the SC petition “out of political survival.” Ungab, who was himself a former chair of the appropriations panel, said: “He (Ortega) doesn’t know me, and I have been in Congress for 15 years, this is my last term. No one is running for a presidential post for us to play politics.” “I will not run for the Senate, I will try to be a congressman again, for re-election only. And also, I don’t deal with that kind of diversions,” said the Davao City lawmaker. Ungab said the reason why he made noise and divulged the alleged unconstitutionality of the GAA is “patriotism” because “that patriotism and idealism in me as a UP (University of the Philippines) student has not died even up to now. I’m sorry, but I don’t deal with that kind of questions, it’s not politics.” President Marcos Jr. last week said Duterte was lying about the alleged missing or blank allocations in the GAA, stressing that a spending measure with blank spaces has never happened in the country’s history and was never practiced by the government.",https://malaya.com.ph/news/national-news/senate-staff-drafted-budget-bicam-report-says-quimbo/
Bicam approves final version of 2025 national budget,"MANILA –The bicameral conference committee on Wednesday approved the final version of House Bill No. 10800 or the proposed PHP6.352 trillion 2025 national budget. The measure retained the PHP733 million budget for the Office of the Vice President. Senators and members of the House of Representatives likewise agreed to continue allcations for the Ayuda para sa Kapos and Kita Program (AKAP), but was reduced to PHP26 billion from PHP39 billion. In his remarks, Senate President Francis Escudero acknowledged the rigorous process undertaken by the bicameral committee to harmonize the differing versions of the proposed budget from the two chambers. “This is the most important legislation passed annually by Congress,” Escudero emphasized, underscoring the crucial role of the budget in shaping the nation’s priorities. He noted the challenges faced in allocating resources, highlighting the principle of balancing additions and cuts. “We cannot increase allocations without making reductions elsewhere. This is why the work on any budget proposal is so demanding,” Escudero said. Escudero also defended the alignment of the budget with President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.'s plans, clarifying that it was not a matter of blind adherence but a recognition of the overwhelming electoral mandate given to him by over 31 million Filipinos.",https://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/bicam-approves-final-version-of-2025-national-budget
